    link: 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4136787/',
    summary: "The Bion-M 1 space mission studied the effects of microgravity on mice. This paper details the rigorous training and selection process used to prepare the mice for the 30-day spaceflight. The process included adapting them to the specific spaceflight cages, food, and water systems to ensure they could survive and provide valid scientific data upon their return. This preparation was critical for the success of the mission's biological research objectives.",

It found that high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, which is more similar to space radiation, is more damaging than low-LET radiation. This is important for understanding the risks of space travel for living organisms.',
